== Description ==

Photo Magic is a powerful & retina-ready Photography WordPress Theme for photographers, illustrators and creative artists but isn't limited to them. The theme customizer comes handy so there is no hassle to worry about. This theme focuses on large photos and allows plenty of gallery, slider and portfolio options and is best for someone with a story to share. Besides the featured post slider, various other options such as varied blog layouts, customizer API, translation ready (compatible with Popular plugin) and many more are available. Its fluid layout & visually responsive design looks great on all devices and screen sizes.
